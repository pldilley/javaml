/**
 * The norm distance or
 * 
 * 
 * This class implements the Norm distance. This is a generalization of the
 * Euclidean distance, in this respect that the power we use becomes a parameter
 * instead of being fixed to two.
 * 
 * The x-Norm distance between two points P=(p1,p2,...,pn) and Q=(q1,q2,...,qn)
 * in the Euclidean n-space is defined as: ((p1-q1)^x + (p2-q2)^x + ... +
 * (pn-qn)^x)^(1/x)
 * 
 * Special instances are x=1, the Manhattan- or taxicab norm. Or x=infinity
 * gives the
 * 
 * The default is the Euclidean distance where x=2.
